When a function includes a list of arguments, it is allowed that the code also declare a default value when no value is provided when the function is called in the code. The first line of printed results indicates this case, when *L, S = func_test()* does not provide the argument values, and the default values of *L = ['a', 'b']* and *S = 'ab'* are used. \n","2. It may come as a surprise that while the same function is called the second time in the same fashion, the returned values of *L* and *S* are different from the first time. This is because an important rule defined in Python regarding the type of an input argument to be mutable or immutable:\n","    * When an argument type is immutable, then its default value will be reset to the one listed in the function definition. In the above example, *S = 'ab'* is immutable string type. Therefore, when its input value is not provided by the function call, the default value is always used.\n","    * When an argument type is mutable, then its default value will be set only once based on the value in the function definition. Subsequently, the default value of a mutable argument remains the same from the last time the function is called. In the above example, when the function is first called, the mutable argument *L* has changed its value to ['a', 'b', 'c']. Therefore, when the function is called the second time without explicit setting the argument value, the default value of *L* is the same value from the last function call. Adding another 'c' to this value will return the result ['a', 'b', 'c', 'c'].\n","   * The third line of printed result illustrates the situation that when a mutable argument is changed inside a function, the modified value is carried over to the outside of the function regardless if the value is part of the function output. However, when an immutable argument is modified inside a function, it is not carried over to change the variable value outside the function. This conclusion makes sense because when the function executes the statement *S = S + 'c'*, the assigned new string *S* is a local string object that has different memory address and ID than the string *S* of the same name outside the function. \n","   \n","   \n","In conclusion, when arguments are passed into a function, mutable variables share the same objects inside and outside the function, while immutable variables do not share the same objects. As a result, changes on immutable variables inside a function do not change the variables of the same names outside. Such immutable variables inside a function are called local variables.\n","\n","Contrast to local variables, Python also defines a keyword called *global* to define global variables. When a variable is declared as global, then Python will force all variables of the same name to share the same object and memory address. Consequently, changing the value of a global variable in one place will affect all the other places in the code when the same variable is used.
